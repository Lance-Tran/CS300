## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem advising a company with what data structure would be best applicable to their system. I had to consider data structures like vectors, hash tables, binary trees. 

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I learned the differences, and the pros and cons between all of them. I am more knowledgable about choosing the appropriate one based on the purpose of application. Data structures are important to understand because you have to consider factors like read time, sorting time, constraints, scalability, memory usage.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I used a lot of StackOverflow and W3Scools and Geeks4Geeks to help understand concepts better. If one didn't help me understand, then maybe another would.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I feel like I have a better foundational understanding of how data structures are formed, their pros and cons, and the algorithms that are used to traverse them. Without this sort of knowledge it would be difficult to code any program that stores data.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I felt like this course was the first time that I felt like I was an employee working on an existing project. Working on the cpp but not needing to make headers or other files, keeping within constraints, and coding functions and using pre-existing methods. It was interesting but made me think more about how my code fit within preexisting framework.
